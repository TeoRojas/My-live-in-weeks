# My Live in Weeks

This is a script that visually shows you the weeks you have spent-lived (with filled squares) and the weeks you have left to live (with empty squares).

Note that this is a mathematical approximation, because not all years have 52 weeks, so it might not add up exactly when your birthday is.

## Usage

```bash
python3 My\ live\ in\ weeks.py
```

## Config

You can change your age of death in line 11, in 'years-to-live=70' change 70 to the age at which you would prefer to die.
